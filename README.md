# Params Practice

Our goal in this project is to get more practice accepting user input via the all-important `params` Hash.

The video walkthrough to Omnicalc Params is the main reference for the `params` Hash. The [Routing Chapter](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/772) may also come in handy.

Here's our target:

[https://params-practice-target.herokuapp.com/](https://params-practice-target.herokuapp.com/)


Start by trying to get `/play/rock`, `/play/paper`, `/play/scissors` _using a single RCAV_, rather than three. This will require using a flexible path segment in your route, and using the `params` hash to see what the user entered in that second segment.

Then try building out the form for Word Count. We'll do Sentiment Analysis together.
